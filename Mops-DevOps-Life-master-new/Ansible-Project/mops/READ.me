This is a project I am working on as part of the DevOps life I have chosen.

1. Pre configures the host that you input
2. Install everything needed for a flask service to run
3. Copying template files for the flask app to the chosen host
3. Monitors changes in the repository and runs a job if something changed
via a webhook




Will keep working and building this up as I go.
(Terraform script exist to spin an AWS instance, will be added later)
